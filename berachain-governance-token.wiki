§ Berachain Governance Token

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

The **berachain governance token** (**BGT**) is a //native// token of [[berachain]] used for //governance//.

**Berachain Governance Token** is often shortened to either **BGT** of **$BGT**.

One key part of [[berachain]]'s design is the separation of the gas token [[bera]] from the //governance token// (**$BGT**).
The hope is that this separation helps address the risk of //staking centralization// and encourages a more balanced distribution of control of the blockchain-network.

Once an [[berachain-address]] has been awarded **$BGT**, it cannot be transferred to another [[berachain-address]].
It can however be //delegated// to try to earn and accumulate rewards.
And it can be traded one-for-one with the //gas token// [[bera]].

**$BGT** can be earned and accumulated by performing certain actions with a [[berachain-authorized-dapp]].

A holder of **$BGT** can delegate **$BTG** to earn and accumulate various rewards.
